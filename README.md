The [ha_cyberq] integration is used to integrate the [BBQ
Guru][bbq_guru] CyberQ Cloud and CyberQ WiFi automatic BBQ temperature controllers.

The BBQ Guru CyberQ Cloud and WiFi are discontinued products.
Information about these controllers can be found on the [BBQ Guru
Support Pages][bbq_guru_support]

This integration aims to enable complete control of these temperature
controllers as well as replace the need for the BBQ Guru Cloud.

## Installation

### The easy way

Add this repository to your HACS with the following button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jchonig&repository=ha_cyberq&category=integration)

Install this integration with the follwing button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=cyberq)

### Manual installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `ha_cyberq`.
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/ha_cyberq/` directory (folder) in this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and
   search for "CyberQ"

## Prerequisites

1. Follow the instructions for your device found on the [BBQ Guru
Support Pages][bbq_guru_support] to connect your device to your WiFi
network in Infrastructure Mode.
1. Make note of the IP address and port number (defaults to 80) of
   your CyberQ.
   
{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Data updates

This integration fetches data from the device every 5 seconds by
default.
The internal webserver of the CyberQ devices fetches data every 1
second, however HomeAssistant has a lower limit on the update
interval of 1 second.

## Notifications

Install the following blueprint to configure notifications from the
CyberQ

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjchonig%2Fha_cyberq%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fcyberq_alert.yaml)

## Known limitations

See [Issues][issues]

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}

After deleting the integration, go to the app of the manufacturer and remove the Home Assistant integration from there as well.
